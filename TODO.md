# To-Do
- CVM Results
- Book 3 - Annex C - Coding of Data Elements Used in Transaction Processing
  - AUC
  - CVM Lists
    - Cardholder Verification Rules
  - Issuer Code Table Index
- Coloured error messages for error values
  - Could look for an index of which status codes are "bad" and which are common/not a problem
- Support other radix values and number prefixes (`0x`, `0b`, `0d`)
- Split into a proper EMV library
  - From a cursory search on crates.io, there doesn't seem to be anything for it
