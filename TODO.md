# To-Do
- CVM Results
- CVR
- TSI
- Multi-bit values
  - CVR has a few of them, where eg. 2 bits are used to form a 2-bit number with one meaning
- Move away from bitflags
- Streamline the process
- Coloured error messages for error values
  - Could look for an index of which status codes are "bad" and which are common/not a problem
- Support other radix values and number prefixes (`0x`, `0b`, `0d`)
- Split into a proper EMV library
  - From a cursory search on crates.io, there doesn't seem to be anything for it
